Classic pong game + parry mechanic
<br>

* Player1:
  	<br>

    * up - w
    * down - s
    * parry - e
<br>

* Player2:
  	<br>

    * up - up arrow
    * down - down arrow
    * parry - space bar
<br>
Parrying makes the players paddle red for a short amount of time. If the ball bounces off of a red paddle it moves faster, making it harder to catch by the oponent
