# Pong

First Java Project

Classic pong game + parry mechanic

Player1: 
    up - w
    down - s
    parry - e

Player2:
    up - up arrow
    down - down arrow
    parry - space bar

Parrying makes the players paddle for a short amount of time. If the ball bounces off of a red paddle it moves faster, making it harder to catch by the oponent
